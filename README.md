MATH111A Project  
The social media influencers (abbreviated as SMI) have a rising commercial effect in China. The social media influencers share their lives on social media and have a tremendous number of followers who admire their elegant lifestyle and personalities. Served as an “expert” in the specific field, for example fashion, food, cosmetics, these social media influencers would share products they used in the field. Different from the advertisements of celebrities on television, social media influencers have a sense of intimacy to common people and their comments about one product present a feeling of authenticity. Their followers will easily become the potential purchasers of their recommended products. Another advantage is the low cost and spreadability of social media. Because of these advantages of working with social media influencers, cooperating with the social media influencers to facilitate sales becomes a popular choice among companies and retailers in China. In this project, I am going to build a dynamic model to simulate the market of a product and investigate the influence of social media influencers on one product. By building this model, I could answer the questions that social media influencers work, by how much the social media influencer contributes to the sales and how different social media influencers perform in my model.
